        <h4>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED  AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE  REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</h4>
        
        <p>Understanding Your Health Record/Information</p>
        <p>Each time you visit a hospital, physician, or other healthcare provider,  a record of your visit is made in order to manage your care. This  Notice of Privacy Practices describes how Rolling Plains Memorial  Hospital may use and disclose your protected health information, your  rights and our responsibilities. Your protected health information is  personal and protected under both state and federal law.</p>
        <h4>Your Health Information Rights</h4>
            
        
        <p>Although your health record is the physical property of the healthcare  practitioner or facility that compiled it, the information belongs to  you. You have the right to:</p>
        

        <ol>
            <li>Request restrictions on certain uses and disclosures. You have the right to request restrictions on how your health information is used or disclosed. However, we are not required to agree in all circumstances to your requested restrictions, except in the case of a disclosure restricted to a health plan if the disclosure is for the purpose of carrying out payment or health care operations and is not otherwise required by law; and the protected health information pertains solely to a health care item or service for which you, or the person other than the health plan on your behalf, has paid the covered entity in full. If you would like to make a request for restrictions, you must submit your request in writing to the Privacy Officer. See contact information below.</li>

        <h4>Revision of Privacy Practices</h4>

        <h4>How RPMH May Use or Disclose your Health Information  for Treatment, Payment and Health Operations</h4>

        
        <p>We will use your health information for treatment. For example: Your  health information may be used by staff members or disclosed to other  healthcare professionals for the purpose of evaluating your health,  diagnosing medical conditions, and providing treatment. For example,  results of laboratory tests and procedures will be available in your  medical record to all health professionals who may provide treatment or  who may be consulted by staff members.</p>
        <p>We will also provide your physician or a subsequent healthcare  provider with copies of various reports that should assist him/her in  treating you once you’re discharged from Rolling Plains Memorial  Hospital. If another provider requests your health information and they  are not providing care and treatment to you, we will request an  authorization from you before providing your information.</p>
        
        <p>We will use your health information for payment. For example: A bill  may be sent to you or a third party payer. The information on or  accompanying the bill may include information that identifies you, as  well as your diagnosis, procedures and supplies used.</p>
        <p>We will use your health information for regular health care  operations. We may use or disclose your health care information for  activities relating to the evaluation of patient care, evaluating the  performance of health care providers, business planning and compliance  with the law. For example: Members of the medical staff, the risk or  quality improvement manager, or members of the quality improvement team  may use information in your health record to assess the care and  outcomes in your case and others like it. This information will then be  used in an effort to continually improve the quality and effectiveness  of the healthcare and service we provide.</p>

So that  your health information is protected, however, we require the business  associate to appropriately safeguard your information.</p>
        <p>Communication with Family: Health professionals, using their best  judgment, may disclose to a family member, other relative, close  personal friend or any other person you identify, health information  relevant to that person’s involvement in your care or payment related to  your care.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>To individuals involved in your care, such as a family member, friend or other person you have identified to be involved in your care or the payment of your health care;</li>
